I have a running series of blog posts on
[learning emacs](/blog/categories/learn-emacs/).  It is a life-long
endeavor.  In this post I'm going to share some of the emacs resources
that I have come across over the years.

### [EmacsWiki](http://www.emacswiki.org/)
This is the definitive source for emacs information (aside from the emacs manual).  There's a ton of information there, some of it is outdated, but it's still worth your time.

### Steve Yegge's Emacs Posts -- [old blog](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants) and [new blog](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/search?q=emacs)
All I can say is that Steve Yegge has written a lot about emacs, and has made some awesome elisp contributions.  I'm a huge fan of js2-mode.  Just do a search for emacs on his old and new blogs. [Effective Emacs](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/effective-emacs)
is a good post to start with.

### [Avdi Grimm's Emacs Reboot](http://avdi.org/devblog/category/emacs-reboot/)
Avdi Grimm is writing about re-doing his emacs config from scratch.
It's very informative and super easy to follow.  I've used some ideas
from his posts.  His [emacs config is on github](https://github.com/avdi/.emacs24.d).

### [emacsrookie](http://emacsrookie.com/)
This site is relatively new, and there are only a few posts on it
right now, but it is quality emacs content.

### [emacsrocks](http://emacsrocks.com/)
Emacs screencasts.  It's another new site, but I can't argue with free content.

### [EmacsForMacOSX](http://emacsformacosx.com/)
This site is very convenient for getting the latest os x builds of
emacs.  Or you can run the build-script yourself
([source on github](https://github.com/caldwell/build-emacs)).

### [Github](https://github.com/search?&q=emacs&type=Everything&repo=&langOverride=&start_value=1)
Search emacs on github.  You will find many other emacs users' configs
hosted there.  Read their configs, and you will learn emacs.  I keep
[my emacs config there](https://github.com/rawsyntax/emacs.d).

Did I miss any useful emacs resources?
