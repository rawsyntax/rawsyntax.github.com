I've recently started locking my screen on OSX. However I found that [Quicksilver's](http://qsapp.com) LockScreen script did not work. I believe it was designed for Leopard.

The workaround I've found is to start ScreenSaverEngine with Quicksilver, and set my Security.prefs to require a password.

UPDATE: This also works in OSX Lion.
