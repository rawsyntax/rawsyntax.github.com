title: Quicksilver Lockscreen
---

{% img /images/quicksilver-lockscreen.png %}

I've recently started locking my screen on OSX. However I found that [Quicksilver's](http://qsapp.com) LockScreen script did not work. I believe it was designed for Leopard.

The workaround I've found is to start ScreenSaverEngine with Quicksilver, and set my Security.prefs to require a password.

UPDATE: In OS X Lion, I've found that ScreenSaverEngine is nowhere to be found.  So I just use the LockScreen button in the menu bar.
