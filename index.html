  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my favorite things about emacs is its javascript modes.  While
there are a million options, I&#8217;m only going to talk about how I edit
javascript with emacs.</p>

<h2>Which Mode do I Use?</h2>

<p>I use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/js2-mode/">js2-mode</a>.  It provides
syntax highlighting and underlines errors as you type.  This mode
doesn&#8217;t come with emacs, it was built by Steve Yegge.  However it is
installable through the ELPA.</p>

<p>One problem I found with this mode is that it has some weird ideas
about indentation.  I personally prefer the indentation from the
built-in <code>js-mode</code> in emacs.  After some googling I came across a
<a href="http://mihai.bazon.net/projects/editing-javascript-with-emacs-js2-mode">blogpost</a>
on fixing indentation in <code>js2-mode</code>.  Starting with that I then made my
own modifications and have a <code>js2-mode</code> that works exactly the way I
want it (code below).</p>

<h2>Editing Javascript in HTML</h2>

<p>In my experience I&#8217;m not always editing pure <code>.js</code> files.  Sometimes
I&#8217;m editing javascript inside a <code>.haml</code>, <code>.erb</code>, or <code>.html</code> file.  The
<code>haml-mode</code> I am using is supposed to have easy <code>js-mode</code> integration.
However I tried to integrate <code>js2-mode</code>, and it was not simple.
Furthermore, the built-in javascript highlighting seems to break on a
regular basis.  Troubleshooting that problem looked like it was going
to take more time than I had. Instead I wrote some elisp to allow me
to quickly create a javascript scratch buffer.</p>

<h2>Javascript Scratch Buffer</h2>

<p>I use this to write javascript and copy / paste between buffers until
I&#8217;m happy with the code.  It&#8217;s a very simple solution to the problem.
It creates a buffer named scratch-js with <code>js2-mode</code>.  It&#8217;s not unlike
the elisp scratch buffer that comes up on emacs start up.  I don&#8217;t
write javascript all the time, so this solution works pretty well for me.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2846414.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>(defun scratch-js ()
  &quot;Create or switch to a javascript mode scratch buffer&quot;
  (interactive)

  (if (not (eq nil (get-buffer &quot;scratch-js&quot;)))
      (switch-to-buffer &quot;scratch-js&quot;)
    (set-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;scratch-js&quot;))
    (js2-mode)
    (switch-to-buffer &quot;scratch-js&quot;)))</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This is admittedly a stopgap solution.  I would prefer to have
<code>js2-mode</code> integrated tightly with <code>haml-mode</code>.  If anyone else has
actually done this, I would love to see the code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About 6 months ago I started using <a href="http://pow.cx/">Pow</a> for serving
my apps in development mode.  It loads any RACK compatible app, and
allows you to access your projects via the <code>.dev</code> and named symlinks
stored in <code>~/.pow</code> (for example <code>http://my_project.dev</code>).  No need to
specify a port either!</p>

<p>Very shortly afterwards I ran into a problem.  When I&#8217;m working on a
Sinatra app, normally I use the
<a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun">shotgun</a> gem for automatic
reloading. I can&#8217;t do that when I&#8217;m running Pow.  So I dug into Pow&#8217;s
documentation.</p>

<p>Pow supports passenger-style reloads via these commands:</p>

<pre><code>touch tmp/restart.txt
touch tmp/always_restart.txt
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s somewhat helpful.  However, remembering to run <code>touch tmp/restart.txt</code> every time I make a change is a pain.  Creating <code>tmp/always_restart.txt</code> reloads every time, but makes the app painfully slow.  I don&#8217;t need a reload for every css / image / js asset that is fetched.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guard</a> to the rescue!  Guard is a
simple tool.  Watch files; run commands on change.  There is already a
<a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-pow">guard-pow</a> gem.  Which touches
<code>tmp/restart.txt</code> on file change.</p>

<p>To use it, add <code>guard-pow</code> to your Gemfile.  Then define a Guardfile
telling it which files to watch.  Your specific files may differ, but
this works for my needs.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1886987.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>guard 'pow' do
  watch('.rvmrc')
  watch('Gemfile')
  watch('Gemfile.lock')
  watch(%r{^lib/*/.*\.rb$})
  watch(%r{^app/*/.*\.rb$})
end
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Finally, run <code>bundle exec guard</code>.  It will print when it restarts pow.
I like this approach because it can be adapted to any RACK compatible
app by changing which files get watched.  Also, it doesn&#8217;t require you
to change any application specific code; It&#8217;s only necessary to add
guard to the Gemfile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/arrow-keys.jpg" class ="center"/></p>

<p>The best thing to do is never to form bad habits in the first place.
However if you didn&#8217;t have any bad habits, you wouldn&#8217;t be reading
this blog post.  Here&#8217;s what has worked for me.</p>

<h3>Make a Note of It</h3>

<p>One of my bad habits was using the arrow keys for navigation in emacs.
It&#8217;s inefficient.  Emacs already has keybindings for next / previous
and back / forward &#8211; and I don&#8217;t have to pick up my hands for those.
The first thing I did was start keeping a short list of bad emacs
habits.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t think about fixing every bad habit immediately.  Just note them
and move on with real work.  These also don&#8217;t have to be bad habits
per say.  They can be inefficiencies as well.  Is there a better way to
do that thing you do all the time, but you&#8217;ve been putting off putting
in the time to build it?</p>

<h3>Fix One Bad Habit</h3>

<p>After years of using the arrow keys in emacs, I decided it was time
for that to stop.  Because my emacs config is versioned.  I can see
that I decided to stop on <code>Fri Sep 16 10:53:49 2011 -0400</code>.  Work on
fixing this one habit until its completely fixed.  My fix was pretty
simple.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1794878.js?file='></script>

<p>Unbind the arrow keys and it becomes pretty tough to use them.  I
don&#8217;t use the arrow keys any more.  Maybe your fix is more complicated.
Maybe it&#8217;s writing an emacs macro for something you do frequently.</p>

<h3>Schedule Time for This</h3>

<p>Its a bad idea to try to fix emacs problems while on a tight deadline
for a project.  However you will find yourself with a spare 30 minutes
or an hour here and there.  Make that your emacs improvement time.</p>

<p>Almost a year ago I found myself with an ever growing emacs problem.
My config files had grown out of control.  They were a huge mess and
impossible to manage.  Even though I was using version control my
config still had lots of local changes and files that weren&#8217;t tracked
at all.  And my github repo was never up to date. I was in need of a
fresh emacs config.  I needed organization and simplicity.</p>

<p>When would I ever have time to rewrite my entire emacs config?</p>

<p>I started making time on <code>Tue Jun 21 18:18:41 2011 -0400</code> as I had read
about <code>emacs-starter-kit (v2)</code>.  Its basis was emacs-24 paired with
the marmalade-repo (for emacs-lisp packages).  I put in an n hour here
and there over the course of a few months.  In mid September it was good
enough to use as my full-time working config.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I use Emacs in GUI mode, I set it up to have two 80 column
windows side by side.  It&#8217;s extremely convention when you need to look
at one section of the code while writing another.  For instance, you
can have the spec file side by side with the code when doing TDD.
Sometimes I want to swap the windows.  This kind of functionality does
not come built in with emacs.  I found the <code>swap-windows</code> function
that I use in Steve Yegge&#8217;s
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/my-dot-emacs-file">.emacs</a>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Up to this point my <a href="/blog/categories/learn-emacs">Learn Emacs</a>
series has been all about how to do cool stuff in emacs.  One of my
personal favorites is <a href="/blog/learn-emacs-align-regexp/">align-regexp</a>.
A while back that stopped working for me.  Now I get an error: <code>Wrong type
argument: markerp, 0</code>.  Emacs doesn&#8217;t always do what I mean.</p>

<h3>First Remove your Config</h3>

<p>Whether you use a single <code>.emacs</code> file or a <code>~/.emacs.d/</code> directory
it is time to remove it.  Personally I keep <code>~/.emacs.d/</code> symlinked to
my <a href="https://github.com/rawsyntax/emacs.d">emacs.d github repo</a> so it iss
quite easy to remove the symlink.  Alternatively you can start emacs
with the <code>--no-init-file</code> option, to skip loading your files. The
rationale for removing your config is simply that it reduces the
number of variables you are dealing with.  Is the problem with your
config or with emacs itself?</p>

<h3>Then Check your Emacs Version</h3>

<p>After I removed my config and tried <code>M-x align-regexp</code> again, I got
the same error.  So its not my config.  If you find you have a problem
with a particular version of emacs <code>M-x emacs-version</code> will tell you
what version you have.  In my case it was</p>

<pre><code>GNU Emacs 24.0.92.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin, NS apple-appkit-1038.36) of 2011-12-02 on bob.porkrind.org
</code></pre>

<p>As I get my emacs builds from
<a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">EmacsForMacOSX</a> or <code>brew install</code> them
myself.  At this point I&#8217;m fairly certain I&#8217;m getting the error as a
result of running a nightly build.  A quick google leads me to
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2011-12/msg00266.html">bug#10249: 24.0.92</a>.
I installed a pretest version, and align-regexp works fine like it
used to..  I would prefer to be running the stable version, but I&#8217;m using
<a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">emacs-starter-kit</a>
for my config, which requires emacs 24.</p>

<h3>Version your Config</h3>

<p>When functionality like this breaks it is really awesome to have an
emacs configuration that is under version control.  I can walk
backwards through any recent changes to find what is causing breakage.
So if your config isn&#8217;t already versioned, version it right now.</p>

<p>PS: I&#8217;m interested to know any emacs topics you&#8217;d like to see a
blogpost on.  I haven&#8217;t been hacking my emacs config much lately, so
I&#8217;m short on ideas for emacs posts.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Too Much</h3>

<p>About 4 years ago, I fell in love with minimalism and tried to get rid of most of my possessions.  I went as far as selling my saxophone, (3) bass guitars,  and bass rig.  This meant not playing music any more.  At the time I decided that playing music was nonessential since it did not relate to programming and didn&#8217;t make any money.  I also sold my bicycle (which meant no more cycling).</p>

<p>Pretty soon after that I was just a guy who programmed at work and
worked on programming projects at home.  In other words, not very interesting.</p>

<p>The great secret of minimalism (taken to an extreme), is that if you
take away everything you are left with nothing.  In my case I realized
I didn&#8217;t do anything for fun anymore.  I&#8217;ve since bought a bass,
bass rig, and bicycle and started teaching myself classical / flamenco guitar.</p>

<h3>Be a Beginner Again</h3>

<p>I think there&#8217;s a problem lurking in many programming communities
(forums, IRC, mailing lists).  Every so often a beginner comes a long
and asks a basic question in the wrong way.  He doesn&#8217;t follow the
rules of the community.  So a long-standing member of the community
replies &#8220;use the search&#8221;, &#8220;read the FAQ&#8221;,  or a similar useless
answer.  Go and search any forum you will find useless results like
this.  This is not only unfriendly, but can pollute search results for
others that visit later with the same questions, which eventually
renders the &#8220;use the search&#8221; solution useless.</p>

<p>While I agree that a community&#8217;s rules of etiquette should be
followed, I think some members of these online communities have
forgotten what it&#8217;s like to be a beginner.  Often newbie may not
know what to search or need some extra explanation regarding a common
problem. I found this to be the case when starting out with <a href="/blog/categories/learn-emacs/">emacs</a>,
wherein reading the manual and using the help system are actually part
of emacs itself and can be confusing if you don&#8217;t even know how to use
the thing.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I recommend trying something other than programming.  Go
for something unrelated.  Something where you will be a complete
beginner.  Try learning a musical instrument, building a bike,
woodworking, etc&#8230;  Next time you&#8217;re helping out a beginner you may
find yourself being more helpful and patient.</p>

<h3>Expand Your Mind</h3>

<p>The other reason to try something new is that it may eventually lead
you to approach programming problems in a different or unconvential
way.  Much of what we do is done by way of analogy.  OOP works by
making a model that approximates real situations.  Eventually you&#8217;ll
run into a real programming problem that can be solved using methods
from the real world.</p>

<p>Furthermore, programming is creative work.  It can be helpful to look
elsewhere for inspiration.  Often I find myself thinking of
programming as an art, as self-expression (albeit with many real world
constraints; self-expression won&#8217;t necessarily create useful
programs).  To get a better idea of what I mean check out <a

Though it is written in a somewhat joking
manner, there is truth in it.</p>

<p>My favorite section is <strong>2.4</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>A novice asked the Master: &#8220;Here is a programmer that never designs, documents or tests his programs. Yet all who know him consider him one of the best programmers in the world. Why is this?&#8221;</p><p>The Master replies: &#8220;That programmer has mastered the Tao. He has<br/>gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the<br/>system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern. He has gone<br/>beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else<br/>sees his code. He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his<br/>programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their<br/>purpose self-evident. Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>The Tao of Programming</strong><cite><a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0931137071/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rawsyntax-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0931137071'>www.amazon.com/gp/product/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Though this style of programming is totally impractical for designing
reliable extensible software, I ponder it every few months because
it is such a different perspective.  What if you were able to write a
program that had the intuitive cohesion of a poem?</p>

<h3>Now Go Do Something Else</h3>

<p>That&#8217;s it.  Try something different and new this year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently built a gaming pc from parts, as my laptop was struggling
to run the latest games even on very low settings.  I did some
googling and came to the obvious conclusion that building a desktop
for gaming is way cheaper than trying to buy a new laptop, and the
desktop gets way better performance.  In fact, this makes it so that I
can stretch my laptop for a few more years, as it&#8217;s only used for web
programming at the moment (and it&#8217;s plenty fast due to its SSD).</p>

<p>At the end of this article I&#8217;ll be listing all the parts I used for my build.</p>

<h3>Before Building a PC</h3>

<p>You will need to take a few precautions.  I recommend using an
anti-static wrist-strap.  They are about $5 and save you from frying
your much more expensive components due to static electricity.  Wear
it like a watch and clamp it to an unpainted metal part of your
computer case.  I used the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z5D1?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rawsyntax-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B00004Z5D1">Belkin Anti-Static Wrist Band</a>
for my PC build.</p>

<p>Get some diagnostic software.  I recommend the
<a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/">Ultimate Boot CD</a>.  This will come in
handy if you have problems getting your system to boot or problems
with it crashing.  It has diagnostic tools for CPU, memory, hard
drive, etc&#8230;  I used it when
<a href="/blog/verify-your-assumptions/">troubleshooting my build</a> and I found
that it was just a bad memory stick causing all my issues.</p>

<h3>Plan your build</h3>

<p>Next you&#8217;ll want to spec out exactly what parts you&#8217;ll be using and
ensure they are all compatible with each other.  A good site for
finding parts and getting the best price is
<a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a>.  If you need help deciding
on a PC build that fits your budget, head on over to
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc">BuildAPC</a>.  I had them recommend me
a gaming PC build for my budget.  They can also help you with advice
on how to actually put the parts together.</p>

<h3>Actually Building a PC</h3>

<p>I recommend that you build the PC with a TDD mentality.  Put in only the parts
necessary to get it to POST successfully.  From then on, I would add
individual components and test them with your UltimateBootCD.  Only
after all the hardware passes tests should you install an operating
system and drivers.</p>

<p>I am recommending this approach after having done it the wrong way
myself.  I put everything in and the operating system before doing any
testing, and I was having random crashes going on.  It took hours of
troubleshooting: read more about
<a href="/blog/verify-your-assumptions/">troubleshooting my build</a>.</p>

<h3>What Parts Did I Use?</h3>

<p>The important part here is that it&#8217;s the 2500k edition, which will

<p>Be sure your power supply has enough watts for your pc build (and
supports crossfire or SLI for your graphics card).</p>

<p>This case has great cooling, and is relatively quiet in my opinion.
If you need quieter, I would replace the hard drive fan with a quieter
one.  It&#8217;s the loudest fan on this thing.</p>

<p>With hard drive prices the way they are now I wanted to save some
money and 500GB is plenty of space for game files.  Some people
recommend a SSD for gaming boxes, and while the performance will
certainly be better, I haven&#8217;t noticed load times being much longer
with this disk.  It&#8217;s fast enough.</p>

<h3>Parts I Had Already</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00302DNZ4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&tag=rawsyntax-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00302DNZ4"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=B00302DNZ4&MarketPlace=US&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=rawsyntax-20&ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rawsyntax-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00302DNZ4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>Though I already had this monitor at the time, as I use it for work,
I&#8217;m listing it here because I highly recommend it.  The picture is
great, it&#8217;s height-adjustable, rotatable, and can be mounted on a wall or
monitor arm.  If the new price is too much for you, you can always
find a refurbished one for about $300.  Most importantly the
resolution is 1920x1200 not 1920x1080 like most monitors these days.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BIFI6E/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&tag=rawsyntax-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003BIFI6E"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=B003BIFI6E&MarketPlace=US&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=rawsyntax-20&ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rawsyntax-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B003BIFI6E" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>This is the best left handed gaming mouse I have found on the market
today.  It also has drivers for both Windows and OS X.  The only
annoying thing about it is that the manufacturer switched the left and
right click.  So out of the box left-click and right-click are
switched.  Luckily this can be adjusted with the drivers.  There are
surprisingly few options for left-handed gamers, and the symmetrical
mice don&#8217;t do it for me.</p>

<h3>Build Results</h3>

<p>All said and done this build cost me $922.79.  It runs current games
on Ultra High settings, and has some room for overclocking or adding a
second video card.  It is also said to support Ivy Bridge CPUs (when
they come out).</p>

<p>Interestingly, building this way allows me to buy a cheaper laptop next time I replace it (I don&#8217;t have to care about the graphics card in my laptop).  So overall it&#8217;ll work out cheaper, and I end up with a much better gaming experience.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve worked on a few side projects over the years.  Sometimes they&#8217;ve
turned out well, and other times I stopped working on them.  How do
you know when it&#8217;s time to throw in the towel and when it&#8217;s time to
push through?</p>

<p>Roughly a year ago a friend and I were working on a bill splitting
system.  It was supposed to solve the problem of splitting bills
between friends.  More specifically, splitting regularly occuring or
one time expenses between roommates.  Rather than worrying about
having cash, or writing a check and waiting for it to cash, we built a
system which piggybacked off of paypal&#8217;s API to send bill and payment
notifications via email, which would generate a web checkout page
where the debt could be paid online through paypal.</p>

<p>See how long the previous sentence is?  Sounds too complicated already
and I&#8217;m the one who built it. The eventual idea was that we would wrap
this in a native client wrapper, so that if you&#8217;re out to dinner with
your friends you don&#8217;t have to worry about splitting the bill.  One
person will pick up the entire bill, split it and send bill
notifications via email to all the other people.  Then the others pull
out their phones and enter their paypal accounts and send payment for
their portion of the bill.  The bill can be settled on the spot.</p>

<h3>Not Every Idea is a Hit</h3>

<p>In a perfect world every side-project would be a hit that turns into
a business that generates lots of profit for little work.  In practice
this actually can be quite difficult to pull off.  Furthermore
sometimes those big hits aren&#8217;t actually big hits when they start.  It
make take a couple of years of work to pull.  But how do you know if
your idea is taking a couple of years to get started or simply not
good at all?  Nobody wants to be a quitter, and worse nobody wants to
quit a good idea that ends up making someone else rich.  But there&#8217;s
also more to life than money.</p>

<p>After working on this idea for a few hours a week for a couple months
we eventually decided to scrap it.  There really didn&#8217;t seem to be a simple
way to make money with this idea.  It may have been a useful service,
but there are already similar free services out there for this.  Over
the years, I&#8217;ve grown to have an affinity for ideas that have
monetization strategies that are simple to understand.  In my
experience, the more complicated it is, the less the likelyhood of
actually making money.</p>

<p>Most importantly I wasn&#8217;t particularly passionate about the idea, and
I didn&#8217;t like the idea of piggybacking off of Paypal because of their
horrible customer service (I recently had my funds availability
delayed for 3 weeks with no explanation, and I&#8217;ve had an account for 7
years and an ebay account with perfect feedback).  But using another
online payment system made the idea less useful because other peer to
peer payment systems simply aren&#8217;t as ubiquitous.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Side Projects</h3>

<p>Often the benefits are not monetary in nature.  In the case of this
bill splitting website, I used it at the time to keep up to date with
rails 3 and refresh my skills a little bit.  I was using Merb for most
projects at work at the time. Furthermore, working on small side
projects now and then keeps you familiar with how to start a project
from scratch and increases the breadth of your knowledge.  If its a
small project with just one person working on it, you have to be the
one to do everything (or at least hire the contractors that will do
the part outside your expertise, which is a skill in itself).</p>

<p>The most important thing is to simplify your idea.  Then build the
simplest thing that could possibly work.  Then keep at it and don&#8217;t be
afraid to re-evaluate your idea.  It doesn&#8217;t make you a quitter to throw out a project that no longer seems reasonable.</p>

<p>Always verify your assumptions.  It will save you time and headache.
I&#8217;ll explain now.</p>

<h3>Building a PC</h3>

<p>I recently built a PC from parts I bought online.  It had been 5 years
since I&#8217;ve built a PC at the time so I&#8217;d forgotten my good habits.  I
put everything together: RAM, CPU, HDD, GPU, motherboard etc&#8230;  and
it booted up and POST&#8217;ed no problems.  I thought I was good to go at
this point.  I managed to install windows and a bunch of drivers, but
then I started getting random freeze ups.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>I thought perhaps it was one of the drivers or something specific to
windows 7 (this is a gaming box, not for work).  So I did a little
digging and actually ended up reinstalling windows bare to rule out
any driver issues.  Long story short, while the box would work fine
for about 10 minutes, shortly thereafter the box would freeze up.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I decided to get a boot CD with some
troubleshooting utilities.  I chose
<a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/">Ultimate Boot CD</a> because it&#8217;s free
and has almost everything you could need for diagnostics.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>For whatever reason, when I built the PC I did it wrong.  I skipped
the testing phase.  I didn&#8217;t test first.  So now I was in a situation
where I was digging through everything to get to the root of the
problem (and hopefully there&#8217;s only one!).  First I tested the HDD
using HDAT2.  Many hours later, it came back clean.  Then I tested
using Memtest86.  Within a couple of minutes it detected an error.  So
I pulled the 2 RAM sticks, and tested each individually, and
determined that I had 1 bad stick of RAM.</p>

<h3>The Point is</h3>

<p>If I had built my system right: plug in as little as possible to get
it to boot and run diagnostics before installing software, I would
have found my problem much faster and saved hours of time.  My problem
here was that I assumed my RAM was good.  So even when you&#8217;re not
programming it&#8217;s important to verify your assumptions and don&#8217;t forget to test.</p>

<p>Recently I read
<a href="http://derekwebb.tumblr.com/post/13503899950/giving-it-away-how-free-music-makes-more-than-sense">Derek Webber&#8217;s post about Spotify</a>,
in which he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am paid $0.00029 per stream of a song on Spotify, and even this amount depends on whether the song is being streamed by a paid user or someone using the service for free.  This means it will take upwards of 3,500 streams of a single song on Spotify to earn $1.00 versus that same revenue for one iTunes song purchase</p><footer><strong>Derek Webber</strong><cite><a href='http://derekwebb.tumblr.com/post/13503899950/giving-it-away-how-free-music-makes-more-than-sense'>derekwebb.tumblr.com/post/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>His article made me think of a time years ago when I wanted to be in the
music business.</p>

<p>When I was about 12 or 13 I started playing bass guitar.  From then on
I was enamored with music.  Playing it, listening to it, thinking
about playing it etc&#8230;  Then when I was in 11th grade I had the
opportunity to take an AP computer science course.  I took it, 5&#8217;ed
the AP test, and promptly stopped programming at all.  By the time I
was in 12th grade I was convinced I&#8217;d go to college as a music
business major.  Play music and get paid?  Sounds like a party right?  Why not?</p>

<h3>Getting Paid (for Music) is Complicated</h3>

<p>My first semester in college we had a silly 0 credit hour course for 3
hours each week where the professors basically talked about the music
business.  They related anecdotal stuff about copyright, various
record label / venue contract issues, and all kinds of other issues.
This class was a big red flag for me.  They went over how you get paid
royalties in various situations and how little you get paid for them
(even if you got a good deal).</p>

<p>The gist of the class as I understood it was that most of the money is
in publishing, and if you&#8217;re not at the top already it&#8217;s basically a
roll of the dice as far as making a comfortable living at it.</p>

<h3>I Didn&#8217;t go to College to Roll the Dice</h3>

<p>If being there wasn&#8217;t helping my chances of getting a good paying gig
after graduating, then why was I there at all?  Furthermore, I
apparently had already taken in highschool all the required math for
my major.  I found that to be ridiculous because math is useful, and
I&#8217;m a nerd at heart.  It&#8217;s just that some how programming has become
cool, or at least that&#8217;s what I tell myself.</p>

<p>While the music business classes were fun and pretty easy (admittedly
these were only first year first semester courses), I got an eerie
feeling that I would have a hard time getting paid after college
because of all these issues that were outlined in that 0 credit hour
class.</p>

<p>Oops, I skipped a part.  I had a summer job at Kroger bagging groceries when I
was 15.  It was then that I realized that bagging groceries doesn&#8217;t
pay enough, and that if I didn&#8217;t do something about it I could be
bagging groceries for the rest of my life.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that
except for the fact that minimum wage isn&#8217;t a living wage (for me).</p>

<h3>Ahh.. Back to Math!</h3>

<p>As the semester drew to a close, I realized that what I most wanted to
do was play with all the computer stuff in the recording studio.
Namely, that G4 Macintosh running all the software.  The choice became
obvious to me.  I changed my major to computer science and added a minor in math.</p>

<p>I felt like that was a pretty good bet for getting a job after
college, and I knew I was reasonably good at it.  Mostly importantly I
felt like that was something worth spending 4 years at college doing.
Now on to the topic of this post.</p>

<h3>About Media</h3>

<p>Enough about me, Back to Derek Webber&#8217;s article.  He concludes his
article by telling his fans to buy or download his music for free, but
he spends most of the words in his article demonizing Spotify.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s mostly angry about how they pay him so little per streamed track,
and how they don&#8217;t pay him the same as artists on big name labels.  It
seems to me, if you don&#8217;t like Spotify&#8217;s deal, don&#8217;t take it.  His
criticisms of Spotify seem to be at odds with his proclamation that
record production costs are at an all time low (meaning the artist can
produce and sell his/her own content independently).</p>

<p>Spotify is about adding another tool to the musicians toolbox.  Yet
another way to make money off your music, if you so choose.  This is a
huge difference from <code>back in the day</code> when musicians had to take the
record label&#8217;s deal or not get any CDs pressed at all.  If anything,
these bad deals that Spotify is able to negotiate are evidence of
musicians making bad deals.  It&#8217;s in Spotify&#8217;s best interest to pay as
little money as possible for music.</p>

<p>Anything Spotify says about being good for the music business
or any other <code>feel good talk</code> is simply marketing speak.  That is, it
is their marketing department&#8217;s job to write up this kind of stuff.</p>

<h3>The Problem Buying Media Legally</h3>

<p>Now I&#8217;m not a Spotify fan even though it seems like I&#8217;m building them
up.  Spotify is part of the problem in a few ways.  Ever since digital
distribution of media started, piracy and DRM have had a symbiotic relationship.
If there were no piracy, there&#8217;d be no need for DRM, and the presence
of DRM punishes customers who try to do the right thing by not
pirating media.</p>

<blockquote><p>Customers think they are buying media, and publishers think they are<br/>selling a license to use that media under certain conditions.</p></blockquote>


<p>That is the core of the problem.  When I buy an ebook I expect to be
able to read it anywhere I want (like a printed book).  When I buy
music I expect to be able to listen to it under any conditions.  If I
want to record it to a cassette I should be able to.</p>

<p>Arguments about piracy are pretty pointless.  On the one hand you have
companies claiming that every act of piracy counts as a lost sale,
when we know that&#8217;s not the case.  A lot of pirates don&#8217;t buy
anything, and then some pirates do make a purchase after trying it out for
free (via a pirated copy).</p>

<h3>It&#8217;s Not All Bad</h3>

<p>There are a number of publishing companies that are doing this right.
They give you an unencumbered copy of the media, and ask you to do the
right thing and not share it.  Pragmatic Programmers is one such
company that is doing the right thing.  That is a message I can relate
to, and I have purchased a couple books from them.</p>

<h3>Back to How Musicians Are Getting Screwed</h3>

<p>I agree that generally musicians are getting a bad deal.  It&#8217;s one of
the reasons I decided not to do that for a living.  I don&#8217;t agree with
the idea that musicians deserve a better deal.  The way the economy
has been for the past few years is evidence that nobody is guaranteed
a good deal.  We are all taking our chances.</p>
